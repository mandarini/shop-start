[previous step](Step04.md) | [home](../README.md)

## What we learned

Now that you learned how to set up Firebase, create a database, a bucket and find your config parameters.
Let's see all these in the app we will be working on.

## Fork & Clone the repo

Fork this repo and then clone it, to start working!
Go to [https://github.com/mandarini/shop-start](https://github.com/mandarini/shop-start) and click the fork button.
Once you have it, then clone it locally so that we can start developing!

## Make it work

Once you have a local copy of this repo on your machine, go to the root of the project and run:

```
npm install
```

Then go to the functions directory:

```
cd functions/
```

and

```
npm install
```

there too.

Now, go back to the root of your project. Serve it and go to `localhost:4200` so that we can see what's wrong with it!

```
ng serve
```
